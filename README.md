Glad to see you here! I'm Iulia, a frontend developer, currently completing my bachelor studies. I have a keen eye for :sparkles:visual design:sparkles: and user experience, and I do my best to bring this passion to every project I work on.

You can find my latest projects pinned below, hope you'll find something of interest to you.
